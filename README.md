The MRC School Management System (SMS) is a stand-alone system designed to streamline the MRC School's internal processes for managing student data, organizing classes, tracking attendance, and reporting. 

The SMS is designed to replace manual and decentralized approaches by concentrating important academic and administrative data into an integrated digital platform. 

This system enables administrators to quickly handle student applications, class rosters, attendance, and grades, whilst granting authorized personnel secure access.
